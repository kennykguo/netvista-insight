# Introduction
The Social Media Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with a centralized platform for managing and monitoring multiple social media accounts.

This project was discontinued because of Flask's strict file structure, which makes programming much more difficult. Some better technologies include TypeScript, which allows for a backend, and easier implementation of functionalities through React.
