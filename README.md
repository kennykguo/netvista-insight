# Introduction
The Social Media Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with a centralized platform for managing and monitoring multiple social media accounts.

This project was discontinued because Flask and gulp must run at the same time, and this makes this program much more difficult to program. Some better technologies include TypeScript, which allows for a backend, and easier implementation of functionalities through React.
